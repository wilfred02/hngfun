<p><strong>A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME</strong></p>
<p class="bio">I dived into programming about a year and six months ago when I was pissed off because I had to stand in queue and wait for a 8 hours a day for 2 days just to get a form to pay for accomodation in my school (FUTO). I was able to build the app with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP but I didn't make the necessary connections to deploy it. Literally I failed but I have learnt my lessons am not looking back.</p>
<p class="bio">Am currently on the verge of finishing my freecodecamp frontend curriculum to hone my programming and problem solving skills in other to tackle more problems in my society, for fellow developers and the world at large.I have joined HNG internship in order to learn how to collaborate with other developers and learn how to work remotely.</p>
