	<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
	<p>I am student in my third year studying Electrical/ Electronic Engineering at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri and looking forward to major in Electronic and Computer Engineering. I completed my Secondary school education at the Federal Science and Technical College, Yaba where I picked up Basic Electronics as my technical subject. I am very enthusiastic about technology, especially the speed at which it is evolving. I am currently into a lot of things but I want to focus on Software development and electronics, I also work greatly with teams; although I may be considered lazy at times, I consider myself a bank of ideas waiting to be executed.</p> </br>
